  <h1>Lighting Design</h1>
  <p>I can not draw. Give me a pencil and a paper and the best I might be able to give you is an oddly proportioned stick man with elephantiasis. (How else would you explain his one fat arm and his one skinny one?) But I do consider myself an artistic person. Give me a stage with the proper equipment, and I can draw you a very clear picture. </p>
  <p> I found that working on lighting design for school shows was a place for my creativity. It started my freshman year oh high school. A fiery red, subtly hitting the back of the accused man’s head, and suddenly his guilt becomes clear. By my junior year of high school I realized that I could transfer this theatrical skill to other activities. I saw how the same red that made a character appear guilty also made a talent show love song seem so much more passionate.</p>
  <p> I learned how I could use lighting just as much to enhance community events (such my town’s annual MLK Day Program) as to contribute to semi-professional theatrical shows (“Doubt”). Maybe I can’t draw, but I can communicate.</p>
